            <h1>Brief introduction to Chongqing</h1>
          </div>
          <div class="content-titel-box">
            <span>Chongqing is a major city in southwest China. Administratively, it is one of China's four direct-controlled municipalities (the other three are Beijing, Shanghai and Tianjin), and the only such municipality in China located far away from the coast.</span>
            <span>Chongqing was called Yu Prefecture in ancient times. It received its current name in 1189, after Prince Zhao Dun of the Southern Song Dynasty described his crowning as king and then Emperor Guangzong as a "double celebration". In his honour, Yu Prefecture was therefore renamed Chongqing subprefecture marking the occasion of his enthronement.</span>
            <span>During the World War Ⅱ, Chongqing was the provisional capital of China.</span>
